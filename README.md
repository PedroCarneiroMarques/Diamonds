Diamond Price Prediction Analysis Summary

1. Data Exploration:

The initial dataset consisted of features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z).
The target variable was the diamond price.
2. Data Cleaning:

The dataset was clean with no missing values or anomalies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of key variables and identify potential patterns.
Visualized relationships between carat and price.
4. Initial Modeling:

Applied a linear regression model initially.
Encountered challenges due to categorical features like cut, color, and clarity.
5. Feature Engineering:

Transformed categorical features into numerical representations.
Implemented Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships.
6. Random Forest Model:

Utilized Random Forest Regression for improved predictive performance.
Achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.87.
Explored feature importances to understand influential factors.
7. Model Evaluation:

Continuously evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.
Observed improvements with the Random Forest model.
8. XGBoost Model:

Experimented with XGBoost, another ensemble method.
Achieved comparable results to Random Forest.
9. Ensemble Approach:

Combined predictions from Random Forest and XGBoost in an ensemble.
Further improved predictive performance.
10. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Conducted hyperparameter tuning for both Random Forest and XGBoost models.
Explored different parameter combinations for optimal results.
11. Residual Analysis:

Analyzed residuals to identify any patterns or systematic errors in model predictions.
12. Scaling Features:

Explored the impact of feature scaling, particularly relevant for certain algorithms like Support Vector Regression.
13. Cross-Validation:

Utilized cross-validation to ensure model generalization to unseen data.
14. Conclusion:

The Random Forest and XGBoost models, individually and in ensemble, demonstrated strong predictive capabilities.
The models explain a significant portion of the variance in diamond prices.
Further improvements could be explored through continuous experimentation with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
15. Future Directions:

Consider exploring additional features or external datasets that may contribute valuable information.
Keep refining and experimenting with different models to find the most suitable for the dataset.
